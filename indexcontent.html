	<li>It turns outs that the newest version of Rasbian has realvnc-vnc-server installed by default which conflicts with xrdp. Instead of installing xrdp on your development platform you can install <a href="https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/">VNC Viewer</a> on your desktop to connect instead of using Remote Desktop Connection. The boot options still need to be set along with ensuring VNC (and I2C) is enabled via Menu > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration > Interfaces and such an image is in the dropbox as before. Please let me know if you have had success purging realvnc-vnc-server and installing then using xrdp.
